        <h1>Maranado Racer </h1>
        <p>Maranado is an Argentine professional Racer and manager. Widely regarded as one of the 
            greatest players in the history of the sport, he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player
             of the 20th Century award.An advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position, 
             Maradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature,
              which gave him a low centre of gravity and allowed him to manoeuvre better than most other players.
               His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, 
               while he would often be singled out by the opposition
